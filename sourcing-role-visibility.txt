> Task: Stakeholder based

Team wise Projects :
> Charts : Team based (Filter projects on TeamId whatever selected in team dropdown)

Logic of filter options to show for Sourcing Admin on Dashboards:
Suppose two Sourcing Admins are available in system:
	- Admin 1
	- Admin 2

Suppose five teams are available in system and Admins are assigned in specific teams as follows:
	- Team A : Admin 1
	- Team B : Admin 2
	- Team C : Admin 1, Admin 2
	- Team D : Admin 2
	- Team E : Admin 1

Options will be shown for Admin 1:
	- My Projects
	- Team Projects (Option group name)
		> Team A, 
		> Team C, 
		> Team E

Options will be shown for Admin 2:
	- My Projects
	- Team Projects (Option group name)
		> Team B, 
		> Team C, 
		> Team D
